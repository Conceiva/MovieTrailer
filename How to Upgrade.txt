Upgrading from v2.0.5 to v2.0.6

v2.0.6 only has client changes.  Simply copy movie_trailers.py and yt-dlp.exe files
over the exsiting v2.0.5 files on your client computer.

Additionally the client software is now available in Windows 64 exe format so
you can use that format instead of movie_trailers.py


Upgrading from v2.0.4 to v2.0.5

v2.0.5 only has client changes.  Simply copy movie_trailers.py and yt-dlp.exe files
over the exsiting v2.0.4 files on your client computer.  Going forward the yt-dlp.exe
file will be checked for an update everytime the Movie Trailers 2 plugin is run.

Also verify that the config file has a value for the new option: 
Max trailers to fetch per category for each run

Upgrading from v2.0.3 to v2.0.4

over the exsiting v2.0.3 files on your client computer.  

Upgrading from v2.0.2 to v2.0.3

v2.0.3 only has client changes.  Simply copy movie_trailers.py file over the 
exsiting v2.0.2 file on your client computer.  


Upgrading from v2.0.1 to v2.0.2

v2.0.2 only has client changes.  Simply copy movie_trailers.py file over the 
exsiting v2.0.1 file on your client computer.  


Upgrading from v2.0.0 to v2.0.1

Because the Mezzmo Movie Trailers Channel has a client and a server compoonent
and because of a config file and database change a slightly more specific upgrade
process is required. The client should be upgraded firsta nd then the server.

Client Upgrade Process

1.  Copy the config file and movie_trailers.py file to the folder where 2.0.0 is running
2.  Edit the config file to your setup.  Note the additional setting on the last line.
3.  Run the client software once to update the database format. 
    A "movie_trailers.py stats" command is sufficient

Server Upgrade Process

1.  Copy the MezzmoPlugin.py file to your MovieTrailer2 folder on your Mezzmo server
2.  Stop the Mezzmo server and Mezzmo GUI
3.  Restart the Mezzmo GUI and Mezzmo server

At this point everything should be working normally
